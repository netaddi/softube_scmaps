# softube_scmaps

repository to store my plugin scmap configs for softube console 1

## some remarks

### 1. single plugin multiple instances

Within one SCMap file works in a way like `MapStart<Default>` `MapStart<Alt1>` etc.
Note that each plugin needs to contain a `PluginDisplayName` field, or console 1 will start with error.
